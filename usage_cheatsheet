Various notes that have proven handy for actually using BeerfestDB for the Cambridge Beer Festivals

General data entry

To get special characters in, go to http://unicode-table.com/, find
the character, and click it. A decent modern browser should offer a
handy "copy to clipboard" button on the popup, and you can paste from
that into the web interface or a mysql command.

Or go to http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/a.htm, find the
character, follow its link, and copy/past from the Java Data ->
string.toUpperCase() or string.toLowerCase() table entry.

Summer Festival

1. Create festival - use web interface
2. Create "Main Beer Order" order batch - web interface
3. a. Can enter small things (e.g. early orders a la Buxton) manually
	good idea to confirm that it "takes" by reloading page
   b. Most order data will go in via load_data.pl
4. Edit beerfestdb_web.yml to update festival name.
	Consult USAGE.txt for other (temporary) edits to beerfestdb_web.yml as needed to allow convenient loading.
5. If using a logo on orders, update the file, i.e. add current to home/images/directory; otherwise skip to step 7.
6. Update beerfestdb/util/templates/order_template.tt2 to refer to shiny new logo.
7. Use dump_to_template.pl to generate order .tex files. You know the rest. e.g.
	> dump_to_template.pl -t templates/order_template.tt2 \
                      -l images/cake.png -o distributor > some_order.tex
	also note: if you don't know what to put for -o option, run script without it and it'll prompt you
	-s option splits into multiple .tex files based on -o option setting; use instead of '> filename.tex' (e.g. '-o distributor -s' yields one .tex per supplier)
   7a. If an order needs a continuation sheet, use the 2015 Boggart order as an example.
 
Info gathering spreadsheet --> load_data input
1. File -> Download as
2. Open; save Order sheet as text .csv
3. Save required columns (e.g. for the 2015 sheet: cut -f1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,12)
4. Delete any rows not ready to order yet
5. Munge SOR:
	a. Duplicate lines
	b. Add a column for order_sor (can repurpose an existing col) to ALL rows
	c. '1' for SOR; '0' for all other rows
	d. Delete extra column(s) from ALL rows
6. Correct columns headers as needed (see list below)
7. Add remaining required columns: festival name & year, product category, order batch, is-final ('1' for yes). Example header row:
    brewery_name	product_name	product_abv	product_style	cask_size	cask_count	order_sor	distributor_name	order_batch	product_category	festival_name	festival_year	order_finalized
8. Feed to load_data.pl with default beerfestdb.yml (i.e. default protected categories including company, product)
	a. if it squawks "Protection error (ProductOrder):" uncomment ProductOrder to create (wait for it) this product order
9. Correct any errors revealed by step 7; confirm that all remaining differences from existing data are indeed new things (make sure nothing is missing or mangled)
10. Unprotect company & product in beerfestdb.yml; load!
11. Spawn 'n' send orders as above
Alternative to steps 1-6: Copy just columns A-F from spreadsheet GUI; don't forget to repeat with updated quantities for any SOR casks. Paste into file destined to be input for load_data.pl.
Note that either approach is error-prone, so check carefully to avoid duplications and omissions.

To load mead or wine data using load_data.pl
  punt and
    1. load everything as some tidy n-gallon measure, e.g. 9 for firkin
    2. change to correct measure in web interface
  OR really punt and just
    a. load up everything as though there's just one of each product/size combo
    b. update quantities in web interface upon arrival, or later (if later, add new lines in web interface or use load_data.pl -- if scripted, don't forget to subtract 1 from each qty)
  (tried this:
    one. include a cask_unit column, set to 'litre'
    two. put number of L in cask_size column; hope no floating point problems bite us
   but got cranky error messages, e.g. "DBIx::Class::ResultSet::find_or_create(): DBI Exception: DBD::mysql::st execute failed: Incorrect decimal value: '50 cL bottle' for column 'container_volume' at row 1 [for Statement "INSERT INTO container_size ( container_measure_id, container_volume) VALUES ( ?, ? )" with ParamValues: 0='2', 1='50 cL bottle'] at /home/tfrayner/beerfestdb/lib/BeerFestDB/Loader.pm line 661")

Cider, perry, apple juice
  - Ciderdom may or may not provide container sizes and quantities. If they don't, there are two options:
        a. include order_batch column, and dummy values for cask_size and cask_quantity (e.g. size 5, qty 1); OR
        b. omit order_batch, cask_size and cask_quantity, and unprotect FestivalProduct in beerfestdb.yml
  - Handle cider & perry ABVs at gyle level (and load correspondingly late in proceedings)

To spawn summer fest programme beer list fodder:
  1. go into mysql command line (% mysql -p beerfestdb)
  2. the query is
	select * from programme_notes_view where festival='[name of festival of interest]'
	e.g. select * from programme_notes_view where festival='41st Cambridge Beer festival' 
  3. invoke from unix comand line to funnel output to a file
	echo 'select * from programme_notes_view where festival="[name of festival of interest]"' | mysql -p beerfestdb > [output_file.txt]
	e.g. % echo 'select * from programme_notes_view where festival="41st Cambridge Beer Festival"' | mysql -p beerfestdb > cbf41_beerlist.txt

To get new info to replace old (e.g. improved tasting notes), use load_data.pl overwrite mode (-o option).

For cask lists (delivery & stillage plan checklists)
  1. Run preload_festival_casks.pl to bring cask entries into existence
        (optional: redirect the 80 bazillion "Creating new cask..." messages to trash file or /dev/null/)
  2. Use dump_to_template.pl with options:
     a. delivery checklist: -t templates/delivery_checklist.tt2 -o distributor
        optional: manually edit .tex to split by day (because of course not quite everything arrives on the specified Wednesday)
     b. cask list for stillage plan: -t templates/stillage_planning.tt2 -o cask_management

When beer comes
  Tick "arrived"
  Products received --> gyle to correct gyle ABVs
  For discrepancies
	can edit size of existing casks
	to add cask, need existing gyle for the beer
	manually assign cask ID, preferably next available in sequence
	  use this query:  select max(cm.cellar_reference) from cask_management cm, festival f where f.festival_id=cm.festival_id and f.name='41st Cambridge Beer Festival';
	NOTE: new casks added at this point should NOT have an order batch assigned
  Prices go in Products Received tab, sale price column

For dip sheets: manually enter "Measurement batches" -- otherwise no dip data slots print out!

If a beer gets condemned, record it for each affected cask in Casks by
Stillage > condemned. Someone should also fill out a "Problematic Beer
Report" form.

If there's a reorder
1. Create a new order batch in the web interface. Use its name in step 2.
2. Create a file with the usual details, as in main order loading. 
   2a. can omit product_abv and product_style if it's all stuff that's been in the main order, as the db will know about it
3. Unprotect ProductOrder in beerfestdb.yml, then load & go!
   3a. also don't forget to flag them as arrived, either in the load file (include order_finalized and order_received, both "1") or the interface.


Wine & Mead
  To make signs come out with "glass" (not "pint"), use web interface:
    Festival -> Products Received -> Wine|Mead ->
    set Sale volume column to glass


October & Winter festivals
  Cellar isn't involved in ordering, so we just do most of the db stuff once beer has arrived.

1. Create festival in web interface.
2. Create file(s) to feed to load_data.pl, much as for summer but with less fuss about SOR. Include columns for both order_finalized and order_received.
	expect to unprotect Gyle and FestivalProduct
	don't forget the bit about updating the festival name
3. Use dump_to_oodoc.pl to spawn programme; the output will almost certainly need some manual tweaking.
	watch out: if you run it more than once with the same output filename, it'll append to the existing file rather than overwrite

Logo
  reduce to ~150 pixels, and flatten (no alpha channel)
  
Allergens
- Script: load_allergens.pl runs in either of two modes
	a. load_allergens.pl --interactive asks what to do if it encounters an allergen not previously loaded
        b. --force-allergens automatically loads new allergens found as column headers (more convenient for early runs, but more dangerous, as it would happily all\
ow misspellings in)
- Loading behaves in a manner analogous to "protect/unprotect", but using command-line options instead of beerfestdb.yaml (like other scripts, do % load_allergens.\
pl -h to see options)
- Database allows present (Y, yes, 1), absent (N, no, 0), unknown (NA, n/a, ND, or leave NULL)
        recommend noting presence or absence that we're told about, and leave unknown/null for anything not specifically mentioned
- Allergen list in Appendix 2
